# CrimsonWave

Crimson Wave is a design for an augmenting a mirror to show where someone is in their menstrual cycle based on Basal Body Temperature (BBT). BBT is collected from a device worn comfortably on their upper arm while they sleep. Crimson Wave was created as part of a Tangible User Interfaces class to explore moving from GUI interfaces to TUI.
