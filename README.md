# Crimson Wave

Crimson Wave is a design for an augmented mirror that shows where the user is in their menstrual cycle based on their Basal Body Temperature (BBT). BBT is collected from a device worn comfortably on their upper arm while they sleep.

A Fall 2017 CS 320 Tangible User Interfaces final project developed by Margaret Flemings, Shanzay Kazmi, and Rachel Pak at Wellesley College. This code can be run on the Arduino IDE.

# Materials used
<li>LightBlue Bean+ </li>
<em>** If you do not wish to use bluetooth functionality, you may also use an Arduino Uno </em>
<li>NeoPixel 1/4 60 Ring</li>
<li>NeoPixel Library</li>
<li>Mirror</li>

<li>Fabrication materials & tools: wires, wire cutter/stripper, soldering iron, tape, 3D printed outter layer, flexible cloth</li> 

<h4>To include an extra tool for measuring symptoms visually:</h4>
<li>Potentiometer </li>
<li>Individual LEDs</li>
<li>Resistors </li>

# Troubleshooting
Make sure to use 1.6.8 version of the Arduino IDE so that the LightBlue Bean+ works properly.

<h4>Under "Tools" on the Arduino IDE</h4>
